# cpsc351_project1_jiffies
 
As directed in the project directions, simple.c properly displays the GOLDEN_PRIME_RATIO, jiffies value, and HZ value on module load. The gcd of 3300 and 24 and the value of jiffies is displayed on module exit.



As stated per the project's rubric, I modified the provided hello.c project so it would display the GOLDEN_PRIME_RATIO on module load and the gcd of 3300 and 24 on module removal. This function is incorporated into the code of both jiffies.c and seconds.c
